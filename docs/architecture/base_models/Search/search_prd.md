# Search System Integration - Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Simplified

## 1. Overview

*   **Purpose**: To define the requirements for integrating a dedicated **Search Engine** (e.g., Elasticsearch/OpenSearch) to provide robust full-text search, filtering, and relevance ranking capabilities across key data entities within the ERP system.
*   **Scope**: Integration strategy, data indexing pipeline (from Django models to search engine), core search API endpoint definition, basic filtering within search results, and security considerations. Excludes building a search engine from scratch or advanced features like query suggestions or personalized ranking.
*   **Implementation Strategy**: Utilize an external Search Engine (Assumption: **Elasticsearch or OpenSearch**). Integrate using libraries like `django-elasticsearch-dsl` or direct API calls via `elasticsearch-py`/`opensearch-py`. Indexing will likely use Django signals and potentially asynchronous tasks (Celery).
*   **Target Users**: All users needing to find information across the system, Developers (implementing indexing and querying), System Administrators (managing search infrastructure).

## 2. Business Requirements

*   **Efficient Information Retrieval**: Allow users to quickly find relevant records (Products, Documents, Contacts, Organizations, etc.) using keyword searches across multiple fields.
*   **Full-Text Search**: Search within descriptions, notes, potentially document content.
*   **Relevance Ranking**: Return the most relevant results first based on query matching.
*   **Basic Filtering**: Allow narrowing search results based on key criteria (e.g., object type, status, date range).
*   **Scalable Search**: Handle searching across large volumes of data efficiently.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Search Engine Integration & Setup
*   **Requirement**: Deploy and configure an instance of the chosen Search Engine (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch).
*   **Library Integration**: Integrate appropriate Python libraries (`elasticsearch-dsl-py`, `django-elasticsearch-dsl`, etc.) into the Django project for interacting with the search engine.

### 3.2 Data Indexing Pipeline
*   **Index Definition**: Define search engine index mappings for each searchable Django model. Specify which fields should be indexed and how (e.g., `text` for full-text search with appropriate analyzers, `keyword` for exact matching/filtering, `date`, `integer`).
*   **Indexable Models/Fields (Initial Scope - Define Explicitly)**:
    *   `Product`: `name`, `sku`, `description`, `tags`
    *   `Organization`: `name`, `code`, `tags`
    *   `Contact`: `first_name`, `last_name`, `organization_name`, `tags`
    *   `Document`: `title`, `description`, `tags` (*Content indexing requires file processing - see below*)
    *   *(Add other key models as needed)*
*   **Synchronization**: Implement logic to automatically update the search engine index when corresponding Django model instances are created, updated, or deleted.
    *   **Primary Method**: Use Django signals (`post_save`, `post_delete`) connected to handlers that update the search index.
    *   **Asynchronous Update**: Use a task queue (Celery) for index updates triggered by signals to avoid blocking web requests, especially for complex indexing or high-frequency updates.
    *   **Bulk Indexing**: Provide management commands to initially populate the index from existing database records and potentially re-index data periodically or on-demand.
*   **Document Content Indexing (Optional - Advanced)**: If searching *within* file content (`Document.file`) is required:
    *   Requires an additional pipeline step using libraries/tools (like Apache Tika, potentially integrated via `elasticsearch-ingest-attachment` plugin or custom processing) to extract text content from files during the indexing process. This significantly increases complexity. *(Defer unless critical initially)*.

### 3.3 Core Search API Endpoint
*   **Endpoint**: Define a primary search endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/search/`).
*   **Request Parameters**:
    *   `q`: (String) The user's search query terms.
    *   *(Optional Filters)*: Basic filters applied to the search query (sent to the search engine):
        *   `type`: Filter by model type (e.g., `product`, `organization`). Uses `_index` or a dedicated `model_type` field in the index.
        *   `organization_id`: Filter by organization scope (requires `organization_id` in the index).
        *   `status`: Filter by a common status field.
        *   `created_after`/`created_before`: Date range filters.
*   **Backend Logic**:
    1. Receive search query `q` and filters.
    2. Construct a query using the search engine's Query DSL (e.g., using `multi_match` query for `q` across indexed text fields, combined with `filter` clauses for parameter filters).
    3. Execute the query against the search engine.
    4. Process the search engine's response (hits, relevance scores).
    5. Format the results for the API response (e.g., list of objects containing title, snippet/highlight, relevance score, link/ID to the original ERP object). Include pagination info.
*   **Response Format**: Define the structure of the search result objects returned by the API.

### 3.4 Search Features (Initial Scope)
*   **Keyword Matching**: Match terms provided in `q`.
*   **Full-Text Search**: Search within defined text fields.
*   **Relevance Ranking**: Utilize the search engine's default relevance scoring (e.g., TF-IDF, BM25).
*   **Basic Filtering**: Support filtering results by parameters defined in 3.3.

### 3.5 Out of Scope (Initial Implementation)
*   Fuzzy search, phrase search, proximity search, wildcard/regex search (can be added later by adjusting search engine queries).
*   Saving search history.
*   Query suggestions / "Did you mean?".
*   Advanced ranking customization.
*   Personalized search results.
*   Searching across external systems.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Infrastructure
*   Deployment and management of the Search Engine cluster (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch).
*   Network connectivity between Django application and Search Engine.

### 4.2 Index Management
*   Define index mappings (field types, analyzers).
*   Implement robust indexing logic (signals, async tasks).
*   Tools/commands for index creation, deletion, re-indexing.

### 4.3 Querying
*   Use appropriate search engine client library (`elasticsearch-py`, `elasticsearch-dsl-py`, etc.).
*   Construct effective search engine queries (Query DSL).

### 4.4 Security
*   **Search Results Security**: Search API results **must** be filtered based on user permissions *after* retrieving results from the search engine, OR the search query itself must incorporate permission filters (more complex, requires user/role/org data in the index). The primary approach is usually post-filtering:
    1. Perform search in engine.
    2. Get list of potential result IDs (e.g., Product IDs, Org IDs).
    3. Perform a database query for those specific IDs, applying standard Django ORM permissions/scoping (`Product.objects.filter(id__in=search_result_ids, ...permission_filters...)`).
    4. Return only the objects the user is allowed to see.
*   Secure connection to the search engine.
*   Restrict access to indexing management commands/tools.

### 4.5 Performance
*   **Indexing Performance**: Signal handlers/tasks should not significantly impact write performance. Bulk indexing should be efficient.
*   **Query Performance**: Search engine query execution must be fast. Requires appropriate engine sizing and index design. Post-filtering database query must also be efficient (uses `id__in`).
*   **Scalability**: Search engine must scale horizontally to handle data/query volume.

### 4.6 Integration
*   Integrates Django models with the Search Engine via an indexing pipeline.
*   Provides Search API endpoint for frontend/clients.
*   Requires Celery (or similar) for asynchronous indexing.
*   Relies on Permissions/Org Scoping for filtering results.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Scalability**: Indexing and querying must scale with data growth.
*   **Availability**: Search functionality should be highly available. Search Engine cluster needs HA.
*   **Consistency**: Search index should stay reasonably synchronized with the database (near real-time or acceptable delay).
*   **Relevance**: Search results should generally be relevant to user queries.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   Users can successfully find relevant information via search.
*   Search API response times meet performance targets.
*   Index synchronization lag is within acceptable limits.
*   Search functionality is reliable and available.

## 7. API Documentation Requirements

*   Document the Search API endpoint (`GET /api/v1/search/`).
*   Detail the `q` query parameter and available filter parameters (`type`, `organization_id`, etc.).
*   Describe the structure of the search result objects returned.
*   Explain that results are permission-filtered.

## 8. Testing Requirements

*   **Unit Tests**: Test indexing logic (e.g., transforming a model instance into a search document). Test search query construction logic.
*   **Integration Tests**:
    *   Requires a running test instance of the Search Engine.
    *   Test indexing pipeline: Create/update/delete Django models and verify corresponding documents appear/update/disappear in the search index.
    *   Test Search API endpoint with various queries (`q`) and filters. Verify relevance and correctness of results retrieved *from the search engine*.
    *   **Crucially**, test the security post-filtering: Ensure the final API response only contains items the specific test user has permission to view, even if the search engine initially found more items.
    *   Test error handling for invalid search queries.
*   **Performance Tests**: Measure indexing throughput and search query latency against realistic data volumes.

## 9. Deployment Requirements

*   Deployment strategy for the Search Engine cluster itself.
*   Deployment of Django application code including indexing logic and search API.
*   Configuration of connection details (search engine host, credentials).
*   Initial data indexing process (run management command).
*   Setup of asynchronous task queue (Celery) and workers for indexing.

## 10. Maintenance Requirements

*   Monitoring Search Engine cluster health, performance, and storage.
*   Managing index mappings, potentially re-indexing data after mapping changes.
*   Monitoring indexing queue/tasks for errors or backlog.
*   Keeping search engine and client libraries updated.
*   Standard backups (DB + Search Engine snapshots).
