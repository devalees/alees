# Address Model - Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Simplified (with Custom Fields)

## 1. Overview

*   **Purpose**: To define a standardized model for storing and managing **physical postal addresses**, potentially extended with **dynamic custom fields**, within the ERP system.
*   **Scope**: Definition of the `Address` data model structure for physical addresses, its core fields, basic validation, and custom field capability. Excludes digital addresses, external validation/geocoding services, and detailed history.
*   **Implementation**: Defined as a concrete Django Model. It should inherit `Timestamped`, `Auditable`. Uses a `JSONField` for custom fields.
*   **Target Users**: Systems/Modules needing addresses (UserProfile, Organization, Contact, Warehouse), Admins, Users entering address data.

## 2. Business Requirements

*   Store physical locations accurately.
*   Support international address formats.
*   Provide a standardized, reusable address structure.
*   Allow adding specific, dynamic attributes to addresses as needed per implementation requirements (via Custom Fields).

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 `Address` Model Definition
*   **Inheritance**: Should inherit `Timestamped`, `Auditable`.
*   **Fields**:
    *   `street_address_1`, `street_address_2`, `city`, `state_province`, `postal_code`.
    *   `country`: (CharField, max_length=2) **Required**. ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code. (Indexed).
    *   `latitude`, `longitude`: (DecimalField, nullable, blank=True).
    *   `status`: (CharField with choices, optional).
    *   **`custom_fields`**: (JSONField, default=dict, blank=True) Stores values for dynamically defined custom fields relevant to addresses.
*   **Meta**: `verbose_name`, `verbose_name_plural`, potential indexes.
*   **String Representation**: Concise address string.

### 3.2 Custom Field Schema Definition (External Mechanism)
*   **Requirement**: A separate mechanism (e.g., `CustomFieldDefinition` model) is needed to define the schema for custom fields applicable to `Address`.
*   **Schema Attributes**: Defines key, label, type, validation, choices, etc.

### 3.3 Data Management & Operations
*   **CRUD**: Standard operations via Admin/API.
*   **Validation**: Basic format/length validation. Country code validation. Custom field validation against schema (in Serializer/Form). *External validation out of scope.*
*   **Uniqueness**: Not typically unique system-wide.

### 3.4 Relationship with Other Models
*   Linked *to* by other models (UserProfile, Organization, Warehouse) via `ForeignKey`. Define `on_delete` behavior (SET_NULL, PROTECT).

### 3.5 Custom Field Validation
*   **Requirement**: Data saved to `Address.custom_fields` must be validated against the corresponding schema defined externally.
*   **Implementation**: Logic in API Serializers or Forms.

### 3.6 Out of Scope for this Model
*   Digital Addresses, External Validation/Geocoding Services, Address History (Audit Log), Complex Address-Address relationships.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Data Management
*   Storage: Standard fields + JSONField.
*   Indexing: Key address components (`city`, `state_province`, `postal_code`, `country`). **Requires DB support (e.g., GIN index) for efficient querying on `custom_fields`**.
*   Search: Basic filtering + potential filtering on custom fields.

### 4.2 Security
*   Access Control: Permissions (`add_address`, etc.). Access often implicit via owning record. Consider custom field access.
*   Data Privacy: PII handling according to regulations.
*   Audit Logging: Log CRUD operations, including changes to `custom_fields`, via Audit System.

### 4.3 Performance
*   Efficient querying on standard fields and potentially `custom_fields` (needs indexing). Efficient retrieval via FK using `select_related`.

### 4.4 Integration
*   Primary target for ForeignKeys.
*   Optional dedicated API endpoints, or manage via owning entity's API. Define how `custom_fields` are managed via API.
*   Integrates with `CustomFieldDefinition` mechanism.
*   Separate integration for External Services (validation/geocoding).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   Scalability (millions of addresses), Availability, Consistency, Backup/Recovery, Accuracy.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   Successful storage/retrieval. Ability to filter. Low data errors. Successful use of custom fields where needed.

## 7. API Documentation Requirements (If API Endpoint is implemented)

*   Document Address model fields (incl. `custom_fields`). Country code standard.
*   Document API endpoints and how `custom_fields` are handled.
*   Auth/Permission requirements.
*   Document how to discover available custom field schemas for addresses (if applicable).

## 8. Testing Requirements

*   Unit Tests (Model, basic validation, `custom_fields` handling logic if any).
*   Integration Tests (CRUD via owning model, FK constraints, API tests including **saving/validating `custom_fields`**).
*   Security Tests (PII access, custom field access).

## 9. Deployment Requirements

*   Migrations (Address table, indexes including for JSONField if needed).
*   Country data validation/choices mechanism.
*   Deployment of `CustomFieldDefinition` mechanism.

## 10. Maintenance Requirements

*   Backups. Data quality monitoring.
*   Management of custom field schemas.
