# OrganizationType Base Model - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview

*   **Purpose**: To define and manage the distinct classifications or categories of `Organization` entities within the ERP system. This model provides a controlled vocabulary for describing the nature of different organizational units.
*   **Scope**: Definition of the `OrganizationType` data model, its attributes, management operations (CRUD), relationship with the `Organization` model, and basic API exposure.
*   **Implementation**: Defined as a concrete Django Model. It **must** inherit the `Timestamped` and `Auditable` Abstract Base Models.
*   **Target Users**: System Administrators (managing the types), Developers (referencing types in logic), Business Analysts (defining necessary types).

## 2. Business Requirements

*   **Standardized Classification**: Provide a consistent and predefined set of categories to classify all `Organization` records.
*   **Extensibility**: Allow administrators to define new organization types as business needs evolve.
*   **Clarity & Reporting**: Enable clear identification and reporting based on the nature of an organization (e.g., filter all "Customers", count all "Departments").
*   **Foundation for Rules**: Serve as a basis for potential future business rules or conditional logic that may vary depending on the type of organization (e.g., different required fields, different allowed relationships).

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Model Definition (`OrganizationType`)
*   **Inheritance**: Must inherit `Timestamped` and `Auditable` abstract base models.
*   **Fields**:
    *   `name`: (CharField, max_length=100) The unique, human-readable name of the type (e.g., "Company", "Department", "Customer", "Supplier", "Location/Branch"). Must be unique. (Indexed)
    *   `description`: (TextField, blank=True) An optional description explaining the purpose or characteristics of this organization type.
    *   *(Consider adding `is_internal` or `category` flags later if needed for grouping types, but keep simple initially).*
*   **Meta**:
    *   `verbose_name = "Organization Type"`
    *   `verbose_name_plural = "Organization Types"`
    *   `ordering = ['name']`
*   **String Representation**: `__str__` method should return the `name`.

### 3.2 Data Management & Operations
*   **CRUD Operations**:
    *   Ability to Create new Organization Types (via Admin UI, potentially simple API).
    *   Ability to Read/List existing Organization Types.
    *   Ability to Update existing Organization Types (primarily `description`). Changing `name` might be restricted or require careful handling due to its use as an identifier.
    *   Ability to Delete Organization Types *only if* they are not currently referenced by any `Organization` record (enforced by `on_delete=models.PROTECT` on the `Organization.organization_type` ForeignKey).
*   **Validation**:
    *   The `name` field must be unique and non-empty.
*   **Initial Data**: A predefined set of essential organization types should be created during initial system setup or migration (e.g., "Company", "Department", "Customer", "Supplier").

### 3.3 Relationship with `Organization`
*   The `Organization` model *must* have a non-nullable ForeignKey (`organization_type`) pointing to this `OrganizationType` model.
*   The `on_delete` behavior for this ForeignKey on the `Organization` model should be `models.PROTECT` to prevent accidental deletion of a type that is in use.

### 3.4 Examples of Types
*   Internal Structure: Company, Division, Department, Team, Location/Branch
*   External Relationships: Customer, Supplier, Partner, Vendor
*   Other: Project, Subsidiary

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
*   Queries retrieving `OrganizationType` by name or ID should be highly performant (it acts as a lookup table). Simple database indexing on `name` (already specified as unique) and the primary key is sufficient.
*   Listing all types should be efficient (expected low number of records).

### 4.2 Security
*   **Access Control**: Managing `OrganizationType` records (Create, Update, Delete) should be restricted to specific administrative roles (e.g., System Administrator). Requires standard Django model permissions (`add_organizationtype`, `change_organizationtype`, `delete_organizationtype`).
*   **Audit Logging**: Changes (Create, Update, Delete) to `OrganizationType` records should be logged in the central `Audit` system (leveraging the `Auditable` mixin for user/timestamp and potentially explicit logging for delete/create).

### 4.3 Integration
*   **Primary Integration**: Serves as the target for the `Organization.organization_type` ForeignKey.
*   **API Endpoint (Optional but Recommended)**: Provide a simple RESTful API endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/organization-types/`) for listing and potentially managing types, protected by appropriate administrative permissions. This allows other services or UI components to fetch the available types.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Scalability**: Should easily handle hundreds of distinct organization types without performance issues.
*   **Availability**: As a dependency for creating `Organization` records, the types must be reliably available.
*   **Data Consistency**: Unique name constraint must be enforced. Referential integrity with `Organization` must be maintained via `on_delete=PROTECT`.
*   **Maintainability**: The model and its management interface should be simple and easy to maintain.

## 6. API Documentation Requirements (If API Endpoint is implemented)

*   OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for the `/organization-types/` endpoint.
*   Endpoint descriptions (List, Retrieve, potentially Create/Update/Delete).
*   Request/response examples.
*   Authentication/Authorization documentation (Admin role required).
*   Error code documentation (e.g., for unique constraint violation, deletion protection error).

## 7. Testing Requirements

*   **Unit Tests**:
    *   Test `OrganizationType` model creation and `__str__`.
    *   Test unique constraint validation on `name`.
    *   Test inheritance of `Timestamped`/`Auditable` fields.
*   **Integration Tests**:
    *   Test CRUD operations via Admin UI or API (if implemented).
    *   **Crucially**, test the deletion protection: Attempt to delete an `OrganizationType` that is currently assigned to an `Organization` and verify it fails with the expected `ProtectedError`.
    *   Test deleting an unused `OrganizationType` succeeds.
    *   Test permission checks for managing types.
*   **API Tests** (If API Endpoint is implemented):
    *   Test LIST, RETRIEVE, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE operations via HTTP requests.
    *   Test authentication and permission enforcement on the API endpoint.

## 8. Deployment Requirements

*   **Migrations**: Standard Django migration for creating the `OrganizationType` table.
*   **Initial Data Population**: A data migration (`migrations.RunPython`) should be created to populate the initial, essential set of `OrganizationType` records upon first deployment.

## 9. Maintenance Requirements

*   Regular backup according to standard database procedures.
*   Administrators may need to add or occasionally update descriptions of types via the Admin UI/API. Deletion is rare due to protection constraints.

## 10. Success Metrics

*   Successful creation and classification of `Organization` records using defined types.
*   Low error rate related to `OrganizationType` lookup or management.
*   Administrator satisfaction with the ease of managing types.
*   No reported issues related to accidental deletion of types in use.
