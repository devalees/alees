# OrganizationScoped Mechanism - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
- **Purpose**: To define the standard mechanism (`OrganizationScoped` abstract base model and associated filtering logic) for ensuring data segregation and multi-tenancy across the ERP system. This mechanism links various data models to the `Organization` entity and automatically filters data access based on the user's organizational context.
- **Scope**: Definition of the `OrganizationScoped` **Abstract Base Model**, the implementation of the automatic queryset filtering logic (enforcement), and requirements related to applying and testing this mechanism.
- **Target Users**: System Developers (implementing models that inherit this abstract model), System Architects (designing data segregation), Security Auditors (verifying multi-tenancy).

## 2. Business Requirements
- **Mandatory Data Segregation**: Ensure data associated with one organization is not accessible to users of another organization by default (enforce multi-tenancy).
- **Consistent Scoping Implementation**: Provide a single, reusable pattern for all modules needing organization-level data isolation.
- **Transparency for End-Users**: Standard data access (listing, retrieving) should automatically apply organizational filters without requiring specific actions from the end-user.

## 3. Core Scoping Mechanism Implementation

### 3.1 Abstract Base Model Definition (`OrganizationScoped`)
- **Implementation**: Defined as a Django **Abstract Base Model** (inherits from `models.Model` and includes `class Meta: abstract = True`).
- **Location**: Defined in a shared location (e.g., `core/models.py` or `common/models.py`).
- **Core Field**: Contains a non-nullable `ForeignKey` relationship to the `Organization` model.
    - Example: `organization = models.ForeignKey(Organization, on_delete=models.PROTECT, related_name='%(class)s_set')`
    - `on_delete=models.PROTECT` (or similar restrictive setting like `CASCADE` if scoped objects should be deleted with the org) is recommended. Default to `PROTECT`.
- **Purpose**: To establish the structural link between an inheriting data model and a specific `Organization` record.

### 3.2 Automatic Scoping Enforcement Logic
- **Goal**: To automatically filter querysets for models inheriting `OrganizationScoped` so that standard list/retrieve operations only return records belonging to the requesting user's permitted organization(s).
- **Primary Implementation**: Override the `get_queryset` method within a **base API ViewSet or View mixin** (e.g., using Django Rest Framework). This mixin must be inherited by all ViewSets serving `OrganizationScoped` models.
    - **Logic**:
        1. Access the `request.user`.
        2. Determine the organization(s) the user belongs to (e.g., via `user.get_organizations()`).
        3. Check for superuser/administrative bypass: If the user is a superuser or has specific bypass permission, return the original unfiltered queryset (`super().get_queryset()`).
        4. Filter the base queryset: `queryset.filter(organization__in=user_organizations)`.
        5. Handle users with no organization assignment (typically return an empty queryset: `.none()`).
- **Rationale for ViewSet Override**: Centralizes logic (DRY), direct access to `request.user` context, allows controlled bypass for specific administrative views if absolutely necessary.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Applying the Scope
- **Model Inheritance**: Any data model requiring organization-level segregation *must* inherit from the `OrganizationScoped` Abstract Base Model.
- **API View Inheritance**: Any API ViewSet/View serving data from an `OrganizationScoped` model *must* inherit from the base ViewSet/View mixin that implements the Automatic Scoping Enforcement Logic (See 3.2).
- **Data Creation**: Processes (e.g., API serializers, service layers) creating instances of `OrganizationScoped` models must ensure the `organization` foreign key is correctly populated based on the user's context or validated input (and user permissions for that org).

### 4.2 Scoped Data Handling
- **Default Filtering**: Standard list/retrieve API calls for scoped models must return only data associated with the user's organization(s) due to the automatic enforcement logic.
- **Permission Integration**: Access control checks (e.g., using the `Permission` system) must operate *within* the already established organizational scope, or be organization-aware. A user needs both organizational access (implicit via scoping) and the specific permission (e.g., 'can_edit_product') to perform actions on scoped data.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Data Management & Performance
- **Indexing**: The `organization` **ForeignKey field must be indexed** in the database table for *every concrete* model that inherits `OrganizationScoped`. This is critical for the performance of the automatic filtering query (`WHERE organization_id IN (...)`).
- **Query Efficiency**: The enforcement logic query (`queryset.filter(organization__in=...)`) must be performant, even with users belonging to multiple organizations or large numbers of scoped records.
- **User Context Retrieval**: The method to retrieve the user's organization(s) (e.g., `user.get_organizations()`) must be efficient and potentially cached.

### 5.2 Security
- **Multi-Tenancy Enforcement**: The automatic filtering logic is the primary technical control ensuring data segregation between organizations. It must be robust against bypass attempts by standard users.
- **Superuser Access**: The bypass logic for superusers/administrators must be clearly defined and carefully implemented.
- **Auditability**: Actions performed on scoped data should ideally be logged by the `Audit Logging System` with both user and `organization` context captured in the log entry.

### 5.3 Integration
- **User Model**: The scoping logic depends on the `User` model (or related profile/membership model) to determine organizational context (`user.get_organizations()`).
- **Base API Views**: Relies on developers consistently using the designated base ViewSet/View mixin for scoped endpoints.
- **Organization Model**: Depends on the `Organization` model for the ForeignKey relationship.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: The filtering mechanism must scale effectively as the number of organizations, users, and scoped data records increases.
- **Performance**: Meet defined performance targets for scoped API list/retrieve operations.
- **Reliability**: The scoping mechanism must function reliably; failure could lead to data leakage or denial of access.
- **Testability**: The mechanism (abstract model structure, enforcement logic) must be thoroughly testable via unit and integration tests.

## 7. API Documentation Requirements
- **Mechanism Documentation**: Clearly document the `OrganizationScoped` Abstract Base Model and the requirement for developers to use it for organization-specific data.
- **API Endpoint Behavior**: Explicitly state in the documentation for *all* relevant API endpoints serving models that inherit `OrganizationScoped` that the returned data is automatically filtered based on the authenticated user's organization context.
- **Superuser/Admin Behavior**: Document how administrative roles might bypass standard scoping filters.
- **Developer Guidance**: Provide clear instructions or examples on how to create new scoped models and API endpoints correctly (inheriting the abstract model and the base view logic).

## 8. Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Test the structure of the `OrganizationScoped` abstract model itself (e.g., field definition). Test helper functions for getting user organizations (`user.get_organizations()`).
- **Integration Tests**:
    - **Core Logic Verification**: Test the `get_queryset` override in the base ViewSet/View mixin extensively. Verify correct filtering for users in zero, one, or multiple organizations.
    - **Data Isolation**: Create data belonging to Org A and Org B in a concrete model inheriting `OrganizationScoped`. Assert that User A (belonging only to Org A) only sees Org A data via standard API calls, and User B only sees Org B data.
    - **Superuser Bypass**: Verify that designated administrative users can retrieve data across organizations when using appropriate endpoints/parameters (if applicable), while standard users cannot.
    - **Create/Update Operations**: Test that when creating/updating scoped data via API, the `organization` field is correctly assigned based on user context or validated input, and cannot be set to an organization the user doesn't have permissions for.
- **Performance Tests**: Measure the performance impact of the automatic filtering join/subquery, especially on list views for tables inheriting `OrganizationScoped` with many records.
- **Security Tests**: Actively attempt to bypass the organizational scoping mechanism via API manipulation or crafted requests.

## 9. Deployment Requirements
- **Migration**: When a concrete model inherits `OrganizationScoped`, ensure the migration adds the `organization` ForeignKey and the required database index. Handle defaults/population if adding to existing tables with data.
- **Code Deployment**: Ensure the base ViewSet/View mixin containing the enforcement logic is correctly deployed and inherited by all relevant API views.

## 10. Consumer Requirements (Developers)
- **Developers** building new features must:
    - Identify models containing organization-specific data.
    - Inherit the `OrganizationScoped` **Abstract Base Model** for those models.
    - Inherit the appropriate base ViewSet/View mixin (containing the enforcement logic) for the associated API endpoints.
    - Ensure data creation logic correctly sets the `organization` field based on context and permissions.
