# [ModelName] - Implementation Steps

## 1. Overview

**Model Name:**
`[ModelName]` (e.g., `Organization`, `Timestamped`, `UserProfile`)

**Corresponding PRD:**
`[Link to or name of the relevant PRD file]` (e.g., `organization_prd.md`)

**Depends On:**
[List of models/modules that *must* be implemented *before* starting this one] (e.g., `User`, `Timestamped`, `Auditable`, `OrganizationType`)

**Key Features:**
[Brief summary of the main functionalities covered by this model/module based on PRD] (e.g., Core organization data, hierarchy via MPTT, custom fields, basic API CRUD)

**Primary Location(s):**
[Main code location based on Project Structure] (e.g., `api/v1/base_models/organization/`)

## 2. Prerequisites

[ ] Verify all prerequisite models/modules listed in "Depends On" are implemented and migrated.
[ ] Ensure the relevant Django app structure exists (e.g., `api/v1/base_models/organization/`).
[ ] Ensure necessary libraries are installed (e.g., `django-mptt`, `django-taggit` if needed by this model).
[ ] Ensure `factory-boy` is set up and basic User/Org factories exist if needed for testing relationships.

## 3. Implementation Steps (TDD Workflow)

  *(Structure this section logically, often following Model -> Serializer -> View -> URL pattern, driven by tests)*

  ### 3.1 Model Definition (`models.py`)

  [ ] **(Test First)**
      Write **Unit Test(s)** (`tests/unit/test_models.py`) for basic model instantiation, `__str__` representation, and any custom methods defined in the PRD (mocking dependencies). Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Define the `[ModelName]` class in `models.py`.
  [ ] Add required inheritance (e.g., `Timestamped`, `Auditable`, `OrganizationScoped`, `MPTTModel`, `TranslatableModel`).
  [ ] Define all standard fields as specified in the PRD (CharField, ForeignKey, JSONField, etc.), including `verbose_name`, `help_text`, `db_index`, `unique`, `null`, `blank`, `default`, `on_delete`.
  [ ] Define `Meta` class options (`verbose_name`, `ordering`, `unique_together`, `indexes`, `MPTTMeta` if applicable).
  [ ] Implement the `__str__` method.
  [ ] Run tests; expect pass (for basic instantiation/str). Refactor model code if needed.
  [ ] **(Test First - Custom Methods)**
      Write specific unit tests for custom model methods defined in the PRD. Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Implement custom model method logic.
  [ ] Run tests; expect pass. Refactor.

  ### 3.2 Factory Definition (`tests/factories.py`)

  [ ] Define `[ModelName]Factory` inheriting from `factory.django.DjangoModelFactory`.
  [ ] Define attributes using sequences, Faker, SubFactory for related models.
  [ ] Implement necessary post-generation hooks if needed.
  [ ] **(Test)**
      Write a simple test to ensure the factory creates valid model instances.

  ### 3.3 Admin Registration (`admin.py`)

  [ ] Create/Update `admin.py` in the model's app directory.
  [ ] Define `[ModelName]Admin` class (inheriting `admin.ModelAdmin`, `MPTTModelAdmin`, `TranslatableAdmin`, etc. as needed).
  [ ] Configure `list_display`, `list_filter`, `search_fields`, `readonly_fields`.
  [ ] Configure `inlines` for related models (e.g., `UserProfileInline` for `UserAdmin`, `ContactEmailInline` for `ContactAdmin`).
  [ ] Register the model: `admin.site.register([ModelName], [ModelName]Admin)`.
  [ ] **(Manual Test):**
      Verify registration and basic functionality in the Django Admin UI locally (requires `createsuperuser`).

  ### 3.4 Migrations

  [ ] Run `python manage.py makemigrations [app_label]`.
  [ ] **Review generated migration file carefully.** Check operations, dependencies, potential issues. Add `RunPython` for data migrations or `SeparateDatabaseAndState` for concurrent indexes if necessary *after* initial generation.
  [ ] Run `python manage.py migrate` locally.

  ### 3.5 Serializer Definition (`serializers.py`)

  [ ] **(Test First - Validation)**
      Write **Unit Test(s)** (`tests/unit/test_serializers.py`) for serializer validation rules (required fields, formats, custom `validate_<field>`, `validate` methods). Test with valid and invalid data payloads. Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Define `[ModelName]Serializer` in `serializers.py` (inheriting `serializers.ModelSerializer`, potentially `TranslatableModelSerializer`).
  [ ] Define `Meta` class specifying `model` and `fields` (or `exclude`).
  [ ] Configure field types and options (`read_only`, `write_only`, `required`, `allow_null`).
  [ ] Handle relationship serialization (PKs, Nested, Slugs - as per API Strategy).
  [ ] Implement `validate_<field>` methods for single-field custom validation.
  [ ] Implement `validate` method for cross-field validation, **including calling model `clean()` if necessary** (as per Validation Strategy).
  [ ] Implement `validate_custom_fields` if the model has `custom_fields`, validating against external schema definitions.
  [ ] Run validation tests; expect pass. Refactor serializer code.
  [ ] **(Test First - Representation)**
      Write **Integration Test(s)** (`tests/integration/test_serializers.py`, needs `@pytest.mark.django_db`) to verify the output structure/representation of the serializer for a given model instance (created via factory). Run; expect failure/diffs.
  [ ] Implement `SerializerMethodField` or override `to_representation` if custom output formatting is needed.
  [ ] Run representation tests; expect pass. Refactor.

  ### 3.6 API ViewSet Definition (`views.py`)

  [ ] **(Test First - Permissions/Basic Structure)**
      Write basic **API Test(s)** (`tests/api/test_endpoints.py`) to check if the expected endpoint URLs exist (expect 404 initially) and if basic permissions (e.g., authentication required) are enforced (expect 401/403).
  [ ] Define `[ModelName]ViewSet` in `views.py` (inheriting `viewsets.ModelViewSet` or other appropriate DRF generic viewsets).
  [ ] Set `queryset = [ModelName].objects.all()` (or more specific initial queryset).
  [ ] Set `serializer_class = [ModelName]Serializer`.
  [ ] Set `permission_classes = [...]` (as defined by RBAC/API strategy, e.g., `[IsAuthenticated, CanViewModelPermission]`).
  [ ] Set `authentication_classes = [...]` (as defined by API strategy).
  [ ] Set `filter_backends = [...]` (including `AdvancedFilterBackend` if applicable, `OrderingFilter`, `SearchFilter`). Configure `filterset_class` / `filterset_fields`, `search_fields`, `ordering_fields`.
  [ ] Set `pagination_class` (use project default).
  [ ] Run basic structure/permission tests; expect pass or correct permission errors. Refactor.

  ### 3.7 URL Routing (`urls.py`)

  [ ] Import the `[ModelName]ViewSet`.
  [ ] Create a DRF `DefaultRouter` instance (or use an existing one for the app/group).
  [ ] Register the ViewSet with the router: `router.register(r'model_name_plural', views.[ModelName]ViewSet)`.
  [ ] Define the `urlpatterns` list including `router.urls`.
  [ ] Ensure this app's `urls.py` is included in the main `api/v1/urls.py`.
  [ ] **(Test):**
      Rerun basic API tests checking endpoint existence; expect 2xx/4xx codes now instead of 404.

  ### 3.8 API Endpoint Testing (CRUD & Features) (`tests/api/test_endpoints.py`)

  [ ] **(Test First - List)**
      Write test for `GET /api/v1/[model_plural_name]/`. Assert status code 200, check pagination structure, check basic content. Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Implement necessary `get_queryset` overrides in ViewSet (e.g., add `select_related`/`prefetch_related`, apply base filtering). Ensure **Org Scoping** logic (from base viewset mixin) is active. Ensure serializer handles list representation correctly.
  [ ] Run list tests; expect pass. Refactor.
  [ ] **(Test First - Create)**
      Write test for `POST /api/v1/[model_plural_name]/` with valid data. Assert status code 201, check response body matches created object. Write tests for invalid data (missing fields, validation errors), assert 400 and error format. Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Implement `perform_create` in ViewSet if needed (e.g., to set owner based on `request.user`). Ensure serializer `create` method works correctly. Ensure **Field-Level Create Permissions** are checked in serializer.
  [ ] Run create tests; expect pass. Refactor.
  [ ] **(Test First - Retrieve)**
      Write test for `GET /api/v1/[model_plural_name]/{id}/`. Assert 200, check response body. Test for non-existent ID (expect 404). Test permissions (different users). Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Ensure serializer handles detail representation. Ensure object-level permissions / Org Scoping checked. Ensure **Field-Level Read Permissions** enforced by serializer.
  [ ] Run retrieve tests; expect pass. Refactor.
  [ ] **(Test First - Update)**
      Write tests for `PUT` and `PATCH /api/v1/[model_plural_name]/{id}/`. Test valid partial/full updates, assert 200, check response. Test invalid data (validation errors), assert 400. Test permissions. Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Implement `perform_update` if needed. Ensure serializer `update` works. Ensure **Field-Level Update Permissions** checked in serializer.
  [ ] Run update tests; expect pass. Refactor.
  [ ] **(Test First - Delete)**
      Write test for `DELETE /api/v1/[model_plural_name]/{id}/`. Assert 204. Verify object is deleted/inactivated. Test permissions. Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Implement `perform_destroy` if custom logic (like soft delete) is needed.
  [ ] Run delete tests; expect pass. Refactor.
  [ ] **(Test First - Filters/Search/Ordering)**
      Write specific API tests applying filter parameters, search terms, ordering parameters. Assert results are correctly filtered/ordered/limited. Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Ensure `filter_backends`, `filterset_class`/`fields`, `search_fields`, `ordering_fields` are correctly configured on the ViewSet.
  [ ] Run filter/search/order tests; expect pass. Refactor.
  [ ] **(Test First - Custom Actions)**
      If the PRD defines custom actions, write API tests for them. Run; expect failure.
  [ ] Implement `@action` methods in the ViewSet.
  [ ] Run custom action tests; expect pass. Refactor.

## 4. Final Checks

[ ] Run the *entire* test suite (`pytest`) to check for regressions.
[ ] Run linters (`flake8`) and formatters (`black`).
[ ] Check code coverage (`pytest --cov`). Review uncovered lines for critical logic.
[ ] Manually test key flows via API client or UI (if available).
[ ] Review related documentation (API docs).

## 5. Follow-up Actions

[ ] Address any TODOs left in the code.
[ ] Create Pull Request for review.
[ ] Update related documentation if necessary.
