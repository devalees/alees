# Advanced Filtering System - Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Revised

## 1. Overview

*   **Purpose**: To define a standardized and **powerful filtering system** enabling complex, potentially nested, data querying across API list endpoints using URL query parameters. The system must support various operators and logical combinations (`AND`/`OR`). It may also include capabilities for defining and storing reusable filter sets.
*   **Scope**: Definition of the filtering syntax, the backend logic for parsing and applying complex filters to Django QuerySets, integration with DRF ViewSets, and potentially models/APIs for storing predefined filter definitions.
*   **Target Users**: API Consumers (Clients, Frontend Applications requiring advanced data slicing), Developers (integrating filtering), potentially System Administrators (managing predefined filters).

## 2. Business Requirements

*   **Precise Data Retrieval**: Allow API consumers to construct complex queries to retrieve highly specific data subsets, combining multiple criteria with `AND`/`OR` logic.
*   **Support Diverse Operators**: Enable filtering based on various comparison types (equals, contains, range, etc.).
*   **Standardized Querying**: Provide a consistent (though potentially complex) query parameter syntax for advanced filtering.
*   **(Optional/Tiered)** **Reusable Filters**: Allow common or complex filter criteria to be saved and reused (e.g., "My Overdue Tasks", "High-Priority Customers in EMEA").
*   **Performance**: Ensure that complex filtering operations remain performant.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Filtering Logic & Operators
*   **Core Requirement**: The system must be able to parse and apply filters involving:
    *   **Logical Operators**: `AND`, `OR` combinations. Nesting of logical groups must be supported (e.g., `(A AND B) OR C`).
    *   **Field Operators**:
        *   Equality/Inequality: `eq`, `neq` (or `=`, `!=`)
        *   Comparison: `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`
        *   Text Matching: `contains`, `icontains`, `startswith`, `istartswith`, `endswith`, `iendswith`, `exact`, `iexact`, potentially `like`/`ilike` (use with caution for performance).
        *   Membership: `in`, `notin` (list of values).
        *   Null Checks: `isnull`.
    *   **Target Fields**: Ability to filter on direct model fields and related fields via Django's `__` notation (e.g., `organization__name__icontains`).

### 3.2 API Query Parameter Syntax
*   **Requirement**: Define a clear and consistent syntax for representing nested logic and operators in URL query parameters. *(This is a critical design decision)*. Examples:
    *   **Option A (Structured JSON in Query Param):** `?filter={"and": [{"field": "status", "op": "eq", "value": "active"}, {"or": [{"field": "priority", "op": "gte", "value": 5}, {"field": "assignee__username", "op": "eq", "value": "admin"}]}]}` (Powerful but complex URL encoding).
    *   **Option B (Custom DSL with Prefixes/Separators):** `?filter=AND(status:active,OR(priority__gte:5,assignee__username:admin))` (Requires custom parsing).
    *   **Option C (Leveraging Existing Libraries):** Explore libraries like `drf-complex-filter` or adapt syntax from standards like OData or GraphQL filtering arguments if suitable.
*   **Decision Required:** Choose and document the specific query parameter syntax.

### 3.3 Filter Parsing and Application
*   **Backend Logic**: Implement a robust parser that takes the query parameter string (based on the chosen syntax) and translates it into a corresponding Django `Q` object.
*   **Integration**: This logic needs to be integrated into a custom DRF `FilterBackend`. The backend will:
    1. Extract the filter parameters from the request.
    2. Parse the parameters using the defined logic.
    3. Generate the appropriate `Q` object(s).
    4. Apply the `Q` object to the ViewSet's queryset: `queryset.filter(q_object)`.
*   **Error Handling**: The parser must handle invalid syntax, unknown fields, or invalid operators gracefully, returning appropriate API error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request).

### 3.4 Filter Definition & Management (Optional - Stored Filters)
*   **If Stored Filters are required:**
    *   **`StoredFilter` Model:**
        *   `name`: (CharField) User-defined name for the filter.
        *   `description`: (TextField, blank=True).
        *   `target_content_type`: (ForeignKey to `ContentType`) The model this filter applies to.
        *   `definition`: (JSONField) Stores the filter structure (fields, operators, values, nested logic) in a defined format (matching the parser's expectation).
        *   `owner`: (ForeignKey to `User`, nullable, blank=True) If filters are user-specific.
        *   `organization`: (ForeignKey to `Organization`, nullable, blank=True) If filters are organization-specific or shared within an org.
        *   `is_public` / `is_shared`: (BooleanField) Flags for sharing.
        *   *Inherit Timestamped/Auditable.*
    *   **Management API**: CRUD API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1/stored-filters/`) for managing these `StoredFilter` records (restricted by permissions).
    *   **Application API**: Mechanism for API consumers to *apply* a stored filter, likely via a query parameter (e.g., `?apply_filter=my_saved_filter_id` or `?apply_filter_slug=my-saved-filter`). The backend would retrieve the definition from the `StoredFilter` model and apply it.
    *   **Combination**: Decide if stored filters can be combined with ad-hoc query parameter filters in the same request.

### 3.5 Configuration
*   Mechanism to configure *which models/endpoints* support this advanced filtering and *which fields* on those models are allowed to be filtered (to prevent arbitrary filtering on sensitive or unindexed fields). This could be part of the ViewSet definition or a separate configuration registry.

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Implementation
*   Develop or integrate a robust parser for the chosen query syntax -> `Q` object translation.
*   Implement a custom DRF `FilterBackend`.
*   (If storing filters) Implement the `StoredFilter` model and its management API/logic.
*   Configure allowed filterable fields per model/endpoint.

### 4.2 Performance
*   **Query Optimization**: The generated `Q` objects must translate to reasonably efficient SQL queries.
*   **Indexing**: **Crucial**. Fields designated as filterable *must* have appropriate database indexes. Complex filters involving multiple fields or relations benefit greatly from composite indexes.
*   **Parser Performance**: The filter string parser itself should be efficient.
*   **Caching**: Consider caching the *parsed* `Q` object structure for frequently used *stored* filters. Caching query *results* is handled by a separate Caching system but is important here.

### 4.3 Security
*   **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all input from query parameters to prevent injection attacks or unintended database queries.
*   **Field Restriction**: Enforce the configuration of allowed filterable fields to prevent users from filtering on sensitive or internal data.
*   **Permissions**: Standard model/row-level permissions (view permissions, org scoping) must still be applied *before or after* filtering. Filtering narrows down results the user is *already allowed* to see.
*   **Stored Filter Access**: Secure the API for managing `StoredFilter` records. Control who can create, view, update, delete, or share stored filters.

### 4.4 Integration
*   Integrates with DRF ViewSets via `filter_backends`.
*   Relies on Django ORM and `Q` objects.
*   Integrates with `ContentType` framework.
*   (If storing filters) Integrates with `User`, `Organization` models.
*   Logs relevant actions (filter creation/update/delete) to the `Audit Logging System`.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Scalability**: Handle complex filter queries against large datasets. Scale the storage/retrieval of stored filters if implemented.
*   **Availability**: Filtering capability should be highly available.
*   **Maintainability**: Parser logic and filter configuration should be maintainable.

## 6. Success Metrics

*   API consumers can successfully construct and apply complex/nested filters.
*   Filtering performance meets API latency targets.
*   Accuracy of filtered results.
*   (If storing filters) User satisfaction with saving and reusing filters.

## 7. API Documentation Requirements

*   **Crucial**: **Thoroughly document the chosen query parameter syntax** for constructing nested (`AND`/`OR`) filters and using operators. Provide clear examples.
*   Document which endpoints support advanced filtering.
*   Document the list of filterable fields and allowed operators for each endpoint/model.
*   Document error responses for invalid filter syntax or restricted fields.
*   (If storing filters) Document the API for managing and applying stored filters.

## 8. Testing Requirements

*   **Unit Tests**: Test the filter parser logic extensively with various valid and invalid syntax examples, nested structures, and operators. Test `Q` object generation.
*   **Integration Tests / API Tests**:
    *   Test API list endpoints with a wide range of complex and nested filter query parameters. Verify correctness of results.
    *   Test different operators (`eq`, `contains`, `gte`, `in`, `isnull`, etc.).
    *   Test filtering on related fields.
    *   Test error handling for invalid syntax or filtering on disallowed fields.
    *   Test interaction with pagination and ordering.
    *   Test filtering respects model/row-level permissions and org scoping.
    *   (If storing filters) Test CRUD operations for `StoredFilter` via its API. Test applying stored filters via query parameters. Test permissions for managing/using stored filters.
*   **Performance Tests**: Test list endpoints with complex filters against large datasets to measure query time and identify indexing needs.

## 9. Deployment Requirements

*   Deployment of the custom filter backend code.
*   Migrations for `StoredFilter` model (if implemented).
*   Creation of necessary database indexes for filterable fields **before enabling filtering in production**.
*   Configuration of filterable models/fields.

## 10. Maintenance Requirements

*   Monitor performance of filtered queries; add/tune indexes as needed.
*   Update parser/backend if query syntax evolves or new operators are needed.
*   Maintain configuration of filterable fields.
*   Regular database backups (includes `StoredFilter` data if used).

---

This revised PRD acknowledges the need for complex nested filtering and incorporates the possibility of storing filter definitions, making it a plan for a more advanced filtering system as you requested. The key next step would be to decide on the specific query parameter syntax (Section 3.2) and whether to include the `StoredFilter` model (Section 3.4) in the initial implementation of this system.
