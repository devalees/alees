# Security Strategy

## 1. Overview

*   **Purpose**: To define the overall strategy, principles, and key practices for ensuring the security of the ERP system, protecting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   **Scope**: Covers secure development practices, dependency management, authentication/authorization reinforcement, secrets management, infrastructure security considerations, data encryption, logging, and incident response planning.
*   **Goal**: Minimize security vulnerabilities, protect sensitive data, comply with relevant regulations, and build trust with users by embedding security throughout the development lifecycle (DevSecOps principles).

## 2. Core Security Principles

*   **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls, assuming no single layer is foolproof.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users, API keys, and system components only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their intended functions (enforced via RBAC).
*   **Secure Defaults**: Configure components and features with secure settings by default.
*   **Input Validation**: Treat all external input (API requests, user data, file uploads) as potentially malicious. Validate and sanitize input rigorously at application boundaries.
*   **Secure Coding Practices**: Follow established guidelines to avoid common web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Regular Updates & Patching**: Keep all software components (OS, database, libraries, frameworks) up-to-date with security patches.
*   **Logging & Monitoring**: Log security-relevant events and monitor for suspicious activity.
*   **Assume Breach**: Design systems with the assumption that breaches might occur and implement measures for detection, response, and recovery.

## 3. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)

*   **Threat Modeling (Periodic):** Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities early in the design phase for critical features or major architectural changes.
*   **Secure Coding Training:** Provide developers with training on common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) and secure coding practices specific to Python/Django.
*   **Code Reviews:** Include security checks as part of the mandatory code review process before merging code. Look for common vulnerabilities, insecure use of APIs, improper handling of sensitive data.
*   **Static Analysis (SAST):** Integrate automated SAST tools (e.g., **Bandit**, potentially linters configured for security rules) into the CI pipeline to scan code for potential security flaws on every commit/build.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Integrate tools (e.g., **`pip-audit`**, **Snyk**, **GitHub Dependabot alerts**) into the CI pipeline and periodically scan project dependencies (`requirements/*.txt`) for known vulnerabilities (CVEs). Establish a process for patching vulnerable dependencies promptly.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (DAST):** Periodically run automated DAST tools (e.g., **OWASP ZAP**) against deployed staging environments to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
*   **Penetration Testing (Periodic):** Conduct periodic manual penetration tests (internal or external third-party) against staging or production environments, especially before major releases or significant changes.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization (Reinforcement)

*   **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication as defined in the `api_strategy.md` (JWT with secure refresh token handling, secure API Key management with expiry). Enforce strong password policies. Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-forcing. Consider Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA) integration (e.g., via `django-otp`) for privileged users or as a user option.
*   **Authorization (RBAC):** Strictly enforce model-level and field-level permissions defined in the `rbac_prd.md` at API boundaries (Views and Serializers). Regularly audit role definitions and user assignments. Ensure API Keys have minimal necessary permissions.
*   **Session Management (if using JWT Refresh Tokens):** Securely manage refresh tokens (e.g., httpOnly cookies if applicable, short expiry for access tokens, mechanism for revocation).

## 5. Secrets Management

*   **Definition**: Secrets include database passwords, external API keys (cloud storage, email service, tax provider, video provider, etc.), Django `SECRET_KEY`, JWT signing keys, TLS certificates.
*   **Storage:**
    *   **NEVER** commit secrets directly into the Git repository.
    *   **Local Development:** Use environment variables loaded from a `.env` file (add `.env` to `.gitignore`).
    *   **Staging/Production:** Use a dedicated secrets management solution:
        *   Cloud Provider Secrets Managers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault).
        *   HashiCorp Vault.
        *   Platform-level secrets (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets).
        *   Securely injected Environment Variables (last resort, ensure platform security).
*   **Access:** Application instances retrieve secrets at runtime from the chosen manager using appropriate IAM roles or authentication tokens. Minimize human access to production secrets.
*   **Rotation:** Establish a policy for regularly rotating critical secrets (e.g., database passwords, API keys).

## 6. Data Security

*   **Encryption in Transit:** Use **HTTPS (TLS/SSL)** for all API communication. Configure web server (Nginx/Apache) or load balancer accordingly. Use TLS for connections to external services (Database, Redis, etc.) where possible/necessary.
*   **Encryption at Rest:**
    *   **Database:** Leverage database-level encryption features provided by the cloud provider (e.g., RDS encryption) or filesystem encryption on the database server.
    *   **File Storage:** Use server-side encryption features provided by the cloud storage provider (e.g., S3 SSE-S3, SSE-KMS).
    *   **Specific Fields:** For highly sensitive data within the database (e.g., certain custom fields), consider application-level encryption using libraries like `django-cryptography` (requires careful key management).
*   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate and sanitize all user/API input (as per `validation_strategy.md`) to prevent injection attacks (XSS, SQLi - ORM helps but validate formats/types).
*   **File Uploads:** Validate file types and sizes. Consider virus scanning upon upload (async task). Serve user-uploaded files securely (avoid direct execution, use appropriate `Content-Type`, `Content-Disposition`).

## 7. Infrastructure Security (Collaboration with DevOps/Platform Team)

*   **Network Security:** Implement firewalls and cloud security groups/network policies to restrict network access to servers (App, DB, Cache, Search) only from necessary sources.
*   **Operating System Hardening:** Keep OS patched. Minimize installed software. Use security best practices for server configuration.
*   **Container Security:** Use minimal base images, scan images for vulnerabilities, run containers as non-root users.
*   **Access Control:** Limit SSH/direct server access. Use bastion hosts if necessary. Implement strong authentication and authorization for infrastructure access.

## 8. Logging & Monitoring (Security Focus)

*   **Audit Logging:** Ensure the `Audit Logging System` captures security-relevant events: logins (success/failure), logouts, permission/role changes, API key creation/revocation, significant data deletions, security setting changes.
*   **Access Logs:** Log all API requests (including source IP, user agent, authenticated user/key) at the web server or load balancer level.
*   **Monitoring Platform Integration:** Forward security-relevant logs (Audit Log, web server access logs, application error logs) to the centralized monitoring/SIEM platform.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts in the monitoring platform for suspicious activities: high rate of failed logins, permission escalation attempts, errors from security components, critical vulnerabilities detected by scanners.

## 9. Incident Response (Planning)

*   **Plan:** Develop a basic incident response plan outlining steps to take in case of a suspected security breach:
    *   Identification (detecting the incident).
    *   Containment (isolating affected systems).
    *   Eradication (removing the threat).
    *   Recovery (restoring systems from backup, patching vulnerabilities).
    *   Post-Mortem (learning from the incident).
*   **Contacts:** Maintain contact information for security response personnel.

## 10. Compliance

*   Identify relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, industry-specific rules) based on user base and data processed.
*   Ensure application design and data handling practices align with compliance requirements (e.g., data minimization, user consent, data subject access requests).
