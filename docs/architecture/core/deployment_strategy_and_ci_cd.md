# Deployment Strategy and CI/CD Pipeline

## 1. Overview

*   **Purpose**: To define the strategy and process for reliably building, testing, and deploying the ERP backend application to various environments (Staging, Production).
*   **Scope**: Covers Continuous Integration (CI) practices, Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) pipeline stages, target deployment infrastructure considerations, branching strategy, and rollback procedures.
*   **Goals**: Automated testing, consistent builds, reliable deployments, reduced manual intervention, faster feedback cycles, safe production releases.

## 2. Core Principles

*   **Automate Everything Possible**: Automate testing, building, and deployment steps to ensure consistency and reduce human error.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Manage supporting infrastructure (servers, databases, load balancers, monitoring setup) using code (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Ansible) where feasible.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure (Ideal):** Aim for deployments where servers/containers are replaced rather than updated in-place, reducing configuration drift.
*   **Environment Parity**: Keep Staging environment as close to Production as possible (infrastructure, configuration, data structure).
*   **Monitoring & Feedback**: Integrate monitoring and alerting into the deployment process to quickly detect issues post-deployment.
*   **Security Integrated**: Embed security checks (SAST, dependency scanning) into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Rollback Capability**: Have defined procedures to quickly revert to a previous stable version in case of critical deployment failures.

## 3. Version Control & Branching Strategy

*   **Version Control System:** **Git**. Hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
*   **Branching Model (Example: Gitflow variation):**
    *   `main`: Represents the latest stable production code. Deployments to production are tagged releases from this branch. Merges only from `release` or `hotfix` branches.
    *   `develop`: Represents the current state of development, integrating completed features. This is the target for feature branches and the source for release branches. CI runs comprehensively on this branch.
    *   `feature/<feature-name>`: Branched from `develop`. Developers work on features here. Pull Requests (PRs) are created from feature branches back into `develop`. CI runs on PRs.
    *   `release/<version-number>`: Branched from `develop` when preparing for a production release. Only bug fixes and documentation updates allowed here. Used for final testing/staging deployment. Merged into `main` (and tagged) and back into `develop` upon release.
    *   `hotfix/<issue-id>`: Branched from `main` to fix critical production bugs. Merged back into both `main` (tagged) and `develop`.

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

*   **Trigger:** On every push to any branch, and especially on Pull Requests targeting `develop` or `main`.
*   **Tool:** Chosen CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
*   **Key Stages:**
    1.  **Checkout Code:** Get the latest code from the relevant branch.
    2.  **Setup Environment:** Set up the correct Python version, install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements/dev.txt` or similar). Set up necessary services if needed for specific tests (e.g., Postgres, Redis via Docker).
    3.  **Linting & Code Formatting:** Run linters (`flake8`, `pylint`) and formatters (`black`, `isort`) checks to enforce code style. Fail build if checks fail.
    4.  **Static Analysis:** Run SAST tools (`bandit`) to check for common security vulnerabilities. Fail build on high-severity issues.
    5.  **Dependency Scanning:** Run vulnerability scans on `requirements/*.txt` files (`pip-audit`, Snyk, etc.). Fail build on critical vulnerabilities without approved exceptions.
    6.  **Run Tests:** Execute the full test suite (`pytest --cov ...`) using test settings (`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.test`). Requires test database access.
    7.  **Build Artifacts (Optional):** If needed, build Docker images or other deployment artifacts. Push images to a container registry (tag with commit SHA and potentially branch name).
    8.  **Coverage Report:** Upload code coverage reports to a monitoring service (e.g., Codecov, SonarQube). Potentially fail build if coverage drops significantly.
    9.  **Notifications:** Notify developers (e.g., via Slack, email) of build success or failure.

## 5. Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) Pipeline

*   **Trigger:** Typically triggered automatically on successful merge to specific branches (`develop` for Staging, `main`/`release` for Production) or manually via the CI/CD platform interface.
*   **Target Environments:**
    *   **Staging:** A dedicated environment mirroring production infrastructure as closely as possible. Used for final UAT, integration testing, and performance testing before production release.
    *   **Production:** The live environment serving end-users.
*   **Key Stages (Example for Staging/Production):**
    1.  **Approval (Optional):** Manual approval step before deploying to production.
    2.  **Fetch Artifacts:** Download build artifacts (e.g., Docker image tagged from CI).
    3.  **Infrastructure Provisioning/Update (IaC):** Apply infrastructure changes using Terraform/CloudFormation/Ansible if necessary.
    4.  **Database Backup (Production):** **CRITICAL.** Trigger and verify database backup before applying changes (as defined in Migration Strategy).
    5.  **Deploy Application Code:**
        *   **(Containers/Kubernetes):** Update Kubernetes Deployments/Services with the new Docker image tag. Use rolling updates or blue-green deployment strategies.
        *   **(VMs/Servers):** Pull new code, install dependencies, collect static files (`collectstatic`).
    6.  **Run Database Migrations:** Execute `python manage.py migrate --noinput` against the target environment's database. **Monitor closely.**
    7.  **Restart Application Servers:** Restart ASGI/WSGI server processes (e.g., Gunicorn, Uvicorn/Daphne) and Celery workers/beat service to pick up new code.
    8.  **Run Post-Deployment Checks/Smoke Tests:** Execute a small suite of critical API tests or health checks against the newly deployed version.
    9.  **Traffic Shifting (Blue-Green/Canary):** If using these strategies, gradually shift traffic to the new version while monitoring health.
    10. **Notifications:** Notify relevant teams of deployment success or failure.

## 6. Deployment Infrastructure Considerations (High-Level)

*   **Target Platform (TBD):** Cloud Provider (AWS, GCP, Azure), Kubernetes, VMs.
*   **Containerization (Recommended):** Use **Docker** to package the application and its dependencies consistently.
*   **Web Server:** Use a production-grade WSGI server (like **Gunicorn**) and potentially an ASGI server (like **Daphne** or **Uvicorn**) behind a reverse proxy (like **Nginx** or cloud load balancer).
*   **Database:** Managed PostgreSQL service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) recommended for production for easier management, scaling, and backups.
*   **Redis:** Managed Redis service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache, Google Memorystore) recommended for production.
*   **Celery Workers/Beat:** Run as separate processes/containers managed by Supervisor, systemd, or Kubernetes Deployments/CronJobs.
*   **File Storage:** Cloud object storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob).
*   **Search Engine:** Managed Elasticsearch/OpenSearch service or self-hosted cluster.
*   **Load Balancing:** Use cloud provider load balancers or Nginx/HAProxy.
*   **CDN:** Use a Content Delivery Network (CloudFront, Cloudflare, etc.) for serving static assets and potentially cached API responses.

## 7. Configuration Management Integration

*   The CD pipeline is responsible for injecting the correct environment variables and secrets (retrieved from a secure source like Vault or a cloud secrets manager) into the application runtime environment during deployment (as defined in `configuration_management_strategy.md`).

## 8. Rollback Strategy

*   **Automated Rollback (Ideal):** If post-deployment checks fail or monitoring shows critical errors, the CD pipeline should ideally automatically trigger a rollback to the previously deployed stable version (code artifact/Docker image). Database rollbacks are much harder (see below).
*   **Manual Rollback:** Define procedures for manually triggering a redeployment of the previous stable version.
*   **Database Rollback:** Reversing migrations in production is generally **not recommended** (high risk of data loss/inconsistency). The primary database rollback strategy is **restoring from the verified backup** taken immediately before the migration run. This requires downtime. Minor schema fixes might be possible via a new "forward" migration.

## 9. Monitoring Integration

*   Deployment events (start, success, failure) should be sent to the monitoring/alerting system.
*   Monitor application health and key metrics closely immediately after deployment to detect issues.

## 10. Testing

*   CI pipeline runs unit, integration, and API tests automatically.
*   Post-deployment smoke tests run against staging and production.
*   Performance and security tests run periodically against staging or dedicated environments.
