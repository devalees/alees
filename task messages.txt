=== FOR IMPLEMENTATION ===
based on project rules and attached implementation steps file do the following:
### 3.9 API Endpoint Testing (`tests/api/test_endpoints.py`)

  [ ] **(Test First - List/Retrieve)** Write tests for `GET /api/v1/organization-types/` and `GET /api/v1/organization-types/{name}/`. Assert 200, check structure, verify initial types are present.
  [ ] Ensure `queryset` and permissions are correct.
  [ ] Run list/retrieve tests; expect pass. Refactor.

with the following MUST follow rules:
- DON'T expand your work beyond this task
- MUST follow the attached document literally
- DON'T AFFECT OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS
- Test coverage score at least 90%
- Follow Project Folder Structure
- Produce the latest state from time to time briefly 


Did you finished the following step:
  ### 3.2 Factory Definition (`tests/factories.py`)

  [ ] Define `OrganizationTypeFactory` in `api/v1/base_models/organization/tests/factories.py`:



=== FOR TEST ===
please run global pytest  to examine some failed tests
-focus on the failing tests
-fix one by one, then run the tests..
-keep running the tests until all tests are passed

- run the tests to verify that the actual implementation is passed


- Produce the latest state of organizationtype implementation priefly 
- Please update the implementation steps file to reflect our latest progress 
- please create postman collection with all environment settings included for all endpoints with examples templates here  
  
- Git Commit with proper description, and push it core branch

git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd






update the implementation steps file to reflect our progress

run npm test to verify that the actual implementation is passed

git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd
git commit --no-verify -m ""


please run global pytest  to examine some failed tests
