based on project rules and attached implementation steps file do the following:
## 4. Final Checks
[ ] Run the *entire* test suite (`pytest`) to check for regressions.
[ ] Run linters (`flake8`) and formatters (`black`) on `core/models.py` and `core/tests/test_auditable_model.py`.
[ ] Review the code, especially the `save()` method override and the middleware dependency.
with the following MUST follow rules:
- DON'T expand your work beyond this task
- MUST follow the attached document literally
- DON'T AFFECT OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS
- Test coverage score at least 90%
- Follow Project Folder Structure
- Produce the latest state from time to time briefly 



- Update the implementation steps file to reflect our latest progress 
  
- Git Commit with proper description, and push it core branch

git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd




## Testing Guidelines:-
- Use centralized testing utilities from `src/tests/utils/`
- NO direct imports from testing libraries
. Test Cover rate at least 90%
- Use `componentTestUtils.ts` for React component tests
- Use `functionTestUtils.ts` for utility function tests
- Use `integrationTestUtils.ts` for integration tests
- Use `mockApi.ts` for mocking API responses
. Follow the existing project architecture
. Use Core Technologies stated in project rules.



=== FOR IMPLEMENTATION ===
based on project rules and implementation steps file and the following plan:
### Phase 3: Organization Management 
2. **Create Organization Components**
   - [ ] Implement organization detail component
     - File: `src/components/features/entity/organizations/OrganizationDetail.tsx`
     - Display organization details
     - Show related departments and teams
     - Add actions for managing organization
     - Ensure edit and delete buttons are present for tests

## Implementation Guidelines:-
1. Use Core Technologies stated in project rules.
2. Reuse existing components and utilities
3. Focus on one feature at a time
4. Follow the existing project architecture
5. All API endpoints @ ## API Integration Details in implementation steps file


update the implementation steps file to reflect our progress
run the tests to verify that the actual implementation is passed
run npm test to verify that the actual implementation is passed

git reset --hard HEAD
git clean -fd
git commit --no-verify -m ""


please run global npm test to examine some failed tests
-focus on the failing tests
-fix one by one, then run the tests..
-keep running the tests until all tests are passed
-add some console logs in potential falling areas
-All tests MUST use the centralized testing utilities and contexts, NO direct testing library imports allowed.


RBAC - Implement first
Entity - Implement second
Contacts - Implement third
Project - Implement fourth
Time Management - Implement fifth
Documents - Implement last
